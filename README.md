- 👋 Hi, I’m Danya.
- 📓 I'm a graduate student at the University of Chicago studying data analytics and public policy, with a focus on public interest technology. 
- 💻 I've worked across the social impact and technology sectors for over 8 years and am currently exploring internships at the intersection of data analytics, government, and public policy. 
- ✨ My interests are in ethics and bias in Artificial Intelligence, algorithmic solutions to administration of public benefits, digital equity, and data privacy and civil rights.
- ✍️ I'm a Senior Editor for the Chicago Policy Review, where I've also published my own [work](https://chicagopolicyreview.org/author/danya-sherbini/).
